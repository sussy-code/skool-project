# Introduction
Chill Pill is a natural dog treat designed to help calm and relax dogs that are hyperactive, 
anxious or easily excited. The carefully selected blend of hemp, chamomile, and other soothing 
ingredients helps promote a sense of relaxation and well-being in overactive dogs. 

# Purpose
Our dog treats are formulated to take the edge off for your pups, helping them
unwind and mellow out without causing drowsiness. Whether your dog gets nervous during storms,
car rides, or separation, Chill Pill can help them settle down and relax.
