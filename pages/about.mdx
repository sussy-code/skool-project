# About us
We started Chill Pills after the siege on Ruby Ridge, during which the dog was unjustly shot and killed out of concern for alerting the Weaver family (as if an unsuppressed gunshot wouldn't have already done so).

## The consequences of Ruby Ridge
The Ruby Ridge incident led to a lot of controversy over how the government handled the situation. 
Many people felt that the law enforcement agencies used excessive force and didn't communicate
properly during the siege causing casualties. This sparked discussions about the limits of governmental power.

## Rocks left unturned
* Lon Horiuchi is still unpunished for his crime of man-slaughter after Idaho state dropped his charges
* To this day no body knows who shot and killed 14-year-old Sammy Weaver
* Some individuals involved deny responsibility
