# About us
We started Chill Pills after the siege on Ruby Ridge, during which the dog was unjustly shot and killed out of concern for alerting the Weaver family (as if an unsuppressed gunshot wouldn't have already done so).

## Design principles
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row' }}>
  <Frame>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
      1. KISS - Keep It Simple, Soldier! - Simple code enhances readability and efficiency.
      2. Ensure UI/UX responsiveness to hovering, scrolling, and other interactions.
      3. Pay attention to layout and contrast, making it stand out from other files while keeping consistency.
      4. Don't do more work for less results. Use frameworks instead like [neatojs's guider](https://neatojs.com/docs/guider).
      5. Create your own style. Create a style unique to you and watch people follow your ideologies.
      <div style={{ margin: 'auto' }}>
        <Button
          to='https://github.com/sussy-code/skool-project'
        >See my code</Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </Frame>
</div>


## Development
<div style={{ width: '75%' }}>
  <Frame>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
      I had a lot of time to complete this site. At first, I thought this would be challenging, as I had to refactor an old project for it. However, it was surprisingly easy to make elements look great with custom styles. Guider uses [.mdx (JSX Markdown)](https://mdxjs.com) files, meaning it renders Markdown and JSX together, making it easy to type and customize quickly. I love JVS's philosophy when it comes to Guider: super simple. I chose Guider instead of something like Wix or Google Sites because I am an experienced UI/UX designer and I feel more comfortable in a textual design environment.

      ### Tools used

  Its definitely not as easy as drag and drop like Wix or Google Sites it takes a little more fiddling to figure out what works. If you can read and follow a guide you can learn pretty quickly and start making decent looking sites, but there is still always so much more to learn.
